html-forms-examples
===================

These are files for teaching students about HTML forms.

Probably all you need to know is [on the index page](http://macloo.github.io/html-forms-examples/index.html).

Scripts are unique to each HTML page, so look in the /scripts/folder for a filename that matches the filename of the HTML.

The CSS for the form elements is in styles/form.css. All the other CSS is in styles/styles.css.

The jquery.min.js file is included so you can run everything offline.

You are free to use and/or modify anything here.
