html-forms-examples
===================

These are files for teaching students about HTML forms.

Probably all you need to know is [on the index page](http://macloo.github.io/html-forms-examples/index.html).

##Files

Scripts are unique to each HTML page, so look in the **/scripts/** folder for a filename that matches the filename of the HTML. For example, **checkboxes.html** and **checkboxes.js.**

The CSS for the form elements is in **styles/form.css.** All the other CSS is in **styles/styles.css.**

The **jquery.min.js** file is included so you can run everything offline if need be.

##Parsley.js

There are two files included from [Parsley.js](http://parsleyjs.org/), a useful jQuery library for form validation. I did not write these! They are only used by one file here, **validation.html.**

##Server-side validation

There's no server-side anything here. Interaction between forms and servers is discussed in **action.html** (a file that has no .js file). 

##License

You are free to use and/or modify anything here.
